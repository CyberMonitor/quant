<P>
We wish to know exactly how the behavior of the spin-1/2 particle, our
qubit, differs from a that of a classical bit. A classical bit can
store either a 1 or a 0, and when measured the value observed will
always be the value stored. Quantum physics states that when we
measure the spin-1/2 particles state we will determine that it is in
the +1/2 state, or the spin -1/2 state. In this manner our qubit
is not different from a classical bit, for it can be measured to be in
the +1/2, or 1 state, or the -1/2, or 0 state. The differences
between the qubit and the bit come from what sort of information a
qubit can store when it is not being measured.

<P>
According to quantum physics we may describe that state of this
spin-1/2 particle by a state vector in a Hilbert Space. A Hilbert
Space is a complex linear vector space.

<P>
A complex vector space is one in which the lengths of the vectors
within the space are described with complex numbers. A linear vector
space is one that you may add and multiply vectors that lie in the
space and the resulting vector will still lie within that
space. (Williams, Clearwater)

<P>
The Hilbert Space for a single qubit will have two perpendicular axes,
one corresponding to the spin-1/2 particle being in the +1/2 state,
and the other to the particle being in the -1/2 state. These states
which the vector can be measured to be are referred to as
<I>eigenstates</I>.  The vector which exists somewhere in this space
which represents the state of the spin-1/2 particle is called the
state vector.  The projection of the state vector onto one of the axes
shows the contribution of that axes' eigenstate to the whole state.
This means that in general, the state of the spin-1/2 particle can be
any combination of the base states. In this manner a qubit it totally
unlike a bit, a bit can exist in only the 0 or 1 state, but the qubit
can exist, in principle, in any combination of the 0 and 1 state, and
is only constrained to be in the 0 or 1 state when we measured.

<P>
Now we introduce the standard notation for state vectors in Quantum
physics. The state vector is written the following way is called a
<I>ket vector</I> |<IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \psi$"> &gt;. Where <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \psi$"> is a list of numbers which
contain information about the projection of the state vector onto its
base states. The term ket and this notation come from the physicist
Paul Dirac who wanted a concise shorthand way of writing formulas that
occur in Quantum physics. These formulas frequently took the form of
the product of a row vector with a column vector.  Thus he referred to
row vectors as <I>bra vectors</I> represented as &lt; <I>y</I>|.  The product of a
bra and a ket vector would be written &lt; <I>y</I>| <I>x</I> &gt;, and would be
referred to as a <I>bracket</I>.  (Williams, Clearwater)
