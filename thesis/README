README for uiucthesis.sty

This is a package for LaTeX2e to create documents that conform to the
UIUC thesis requirements.  To install the package, you have to copy
uiucthesis.sty and setspace.sty to somewhere that latex can find them.

The following files come pregenerated as part of the distribution, but
you can run 'tex uiucthesis.ins' to recreate them from scratch:

    uiucthesis.sty : The style file.
    thesis-ex.tex  : An example thesis using uiucthesis.sty

If you get an error running 'tex uiucthesis.ins', it's because
you have an old version of docstrip.tex.  Please don't tell *me* about it,
tell the person who maintains your LaTeX installation.  Any version
of docstrip.tex more recent than December 1995 should work correctly.

The package also includes a style file that uiucthesis.sty depends on:

    setspace.sty : Used by uiucthesis.sty to adjust line spacing.

To produce the documentation for the package, run latex on
uiucthesis.dtx.
