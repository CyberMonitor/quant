\chapter*{List of Abbreviations}
\begin{description}
\item[$A \times B$:] The Cartesian product of the sets $A$ and $B$.
\item[AND:] The Boolean function that returns 1 if and only if every input bit is 1.
\item[$D(f)$:] The decision tree complexity of the function $f$.
\item[$D(f,x)$:] The minimum number of bits of input $x$ that determine the value of $f(x)$.
\item[$D_{0}(f)$:] The nondeterministic decision tree complexity 
of verifying that $f(x) = 0$.
\item[$D_{1}(f)$:] The nondeterministic decision tree complexity 
of verifying that $f(x) = 1$.
\item[$N(f)$:] The nondeterministic decision tree complexity of the function $f$.
\item[OR:] The Boolean function that returns 0 if and only if every input bit is 0.
\item[PARITY:] The Boolean function that returns 1 if and only if the number of 1 bits in the input is even.
\item[MAJORITY:] The Boolean function that returns 1 if and only if more than half of the input bits are 1.
