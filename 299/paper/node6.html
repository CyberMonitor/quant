Church-Turing Thesis</A>
</H2>

<P>
This bold claim, that any computer is essentially equivalent to a
Turing machine grew out of contemporaneous work by Alonzo Church and
Alan Turing, and is variously referred to as Church's Thesis, the
Church-Turing Thesis, the Turing-Church thesis, the Church-Turing
conjecture, and Turing's thesis.  There are several equivalent
formulations of the thesis stated at different times and to different
degrees of rigor, but the central idea is that:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every effectively calculable function can be produced by a
        Turing machine.
        
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The claim here is that anything which one would like to compute, which
one reasonably could compute (for instance given pen and paper, and
enough time), are precisely those things which a Turing machine can
compute.

<P>
The Church Turing thesis is perhaps best understood as a
<B>definition</B> of the types of functions that are calculable in
the real world - not as a theorem to be proven.  As evidence for the
suitability of this as a definition, multiple (indeed every one
considered to far) distinct models of computation have been shown to
be equivalent to the Turing model with regard to what functions they
can compute.

<P>
Beyond the mere ability of a computing device to calculate a function
is the consideration of how long it would take to do so.  This notion
is generalized by the time complexity of a given algorithm, which
considers the number of steps or operations an algorithm would have
to perform relative to the length of the input in order to compute the
function.

<P>
There are various extensions of the Church-Turing thesis that address
the relative efficiency of different models of computation, such as
the <B>Complexity-Theoretic Church-Turing Thesis</B> states that:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model
        of computation.
	
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here <I>efficiently</I> means a Turing machine can simulate any
realistic model of computation with at most polynomial time expansion
of the computation time or other resources (such as memory).  This
hypothesis may be viewed either as a definition of what a realistic
model of computation is, or as a statement of fact (which may turn out
to be false) about realistic models of computation.  There are no
known models of computation which are thought to be realizable that
violate this thesis.  The discovery of a model which did violate this
thesis would likely be an astonishing breakthrough in the fields of
computational complexity, computer science, and/or physics.

<P>
These theses gives us insight into the power of computing machines.
If a computer theoretically can compute all the functions a Turing
machine can compute (given enough memory and time) then it is as
powerful as a Turing machine.

<P>
