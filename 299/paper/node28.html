<H2><A NAME="SECTION00074000000000000000">
The Simulation of Shor's Algorithm</A>
</H2>

<P>
The implementation of Shor's algorithm found in shor.C follows the
steps outlined in the description of Shor's algorithm found above.
There are some significant differences in the behavior of the
simulator and the behavior of a actual quantum computer.

<P>
The simulator uses 2<SUP>n+1</SUP> double precision floating point numbers
to represent the state of the quantum register. It uses one Complex
object to represent the probability amplitude of each of the 2<SUP>n</SUP>
eigenstates of a <I>n</I> bit quantum memory register, and each Complex
object uses two double precision floating point numbers. On a machine
in which a double precision floating point number is represented with
64 bits the simulator uses approximately 2<SUP>n+7</SUP> classical bits used
to represent the state of the quantum memory register, where <I>n</I> is
the number of bits required to represent the number the simulator is
trying to factor. A real quantum computer would use exactly <I>n</I> qubits
as its memory register. This exponential space usage is apparently
unavoidable, as a classical computer cannot simply cannot simulate a
quantum computer without suffering from exponential time or space
overhead if the Complexity-Theoretic Church-Turing Thesis holds.

<P>
A second large difference is that during the modular exponentiation
step of Shor's algorithm (Step 6 above) a quantum computer would
perform one operation of <!-- MATH
 $x^{a} \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>a</SUP> mod <I>n</I>, where a is the superposition
of states in register 1. The simulation must calculate the
superposition of values caused by calculating <!-- MATH
 $x^{a} \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>a</SUP> mod <I>n</I> for <I>a</I> = 0 through <I>q</I> - 1 iteratively. The simulation also stores the result
of each modular exponentiation, and uses that information to collapse
register 1 in step 7 in Shor's algorithm. A quantum computer would not
be capable of performing this book keeping, as examining any
particular result would collapse the existing superposition to be
placed in register 2 at the end of step 6 of Shor's algorithm. A
quantum computer would have no need whatsoever to do such bookkeeping,
as when when register 2 is measured in step 7, the collapse of
register 1 is an automatic and unavoidable consequence of the
measurement. A analogous argument follows for the use of the get
probability function in step 8 of Shor's algorithm for calculating the
discrete Fourier transform.

<P>
Aside from these differences, which are necessitated by the inability
of a classical computer to accurately depict the behavior of a quantum
mechanical system, the operations are performed by the shor.C
program are identical to those called for in the description of Shor's
algorithm.

<P>
As the algorithm runs the state of the quantum memory register changes
in the manner laid out in the description of Shor's algorithm.  After
the final measurement of register 1 in step 9 we obtain some integer
<I>m</I>, which has a high probability of being an integer multiple
<IMG

 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ \lambda$"> of <I>q</I>/<I>r</I>, where <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ \lambda$"> is some integer, and <I>r</I> is the
period of <!-- MATH
 $x^{a} \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>a</SUP> mod <I>n</I> that we are trying to find, so that we may
calculate <!-- MATH
 $x^{r/2} - 1 \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>r/2</SUP> -1 mod <I>n</I> and <!-- MATH
 $x^{r/2} + 1 \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>r/2</SUP> +1 mod <I>n</I> in an effort
to find numbers which share factors with <I>n</I>.

<P>
In the post processing step shor.C takes the integer <I>m</I> and divides
it by <I>q</I>, thus yielding some number <I>c</I> which is approximately equal
to <!-- MATH
 $\lambda / r$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ \lambda$">/<I>r</I>, where <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ \lambda$"> is an integer, and <I>r</I> is the
desired period. Then using a helper function it calculates the best
rational approximation to <I>c</I> which has a denominator that is less
than or equal to <I>q</I> (recall that <I>q</I> is the power of two such that
<!-- MATH
 $n^{2} \leq q < 2n^{2}$
 -->
<I>n</I><SUP>2</SUP> <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.png"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> <I>q</I> &lt; 2<I>n</I><SUP>2</SUP>, where <I>n</I> is the number to be factored by
Shor's algorithm).

<P>
We take this denominator to be our period.  Shor's algorithm can only
use even periods in determining factors of <I>n</I>, and so we check to see
if <I>r</I> is even, if not we check to see if doubling the period would
still yield a period less than <I>q</I>, if so we double our guessed
period.

<P>
Taking the period, which is now guaranteed to be even, we proceed to
calculate <!-- MATH
 $x^{r/2} - 1 \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>r/2</SUP> -1 mod <I>n</I> and <!-- MATH
 $x^{r/2} + 1 \bmod n$
 -->
<I>x</I><SUP>r/2</SUP> +1 mod <I>n</I>, calling
these values <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>, we compute the greatest common denominator
of <I>a</I> and <I>n</I>, and <I>b</I> and <I>n</I>, to see if we have attained a
nontrivial factor of <I>n</I>.
